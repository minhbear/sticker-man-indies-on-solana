# 🎮 Testing Guide - Weapon System & Dual Controls

## Issues Fixed:

### ✅ **1. Weapon Spawning**
- **Problem**: Weapons weren't appearing on the map
- **Solution**: 
  - Added debug logs to track weapon spawning
  - Reduced timer to 10 seconds for faster testing
  - Added immediate weapon spawn 2 seconds after game starts
  - Enhanced server-side logging

### ✅ **2. Dual Player Controls** 
- **Problem**: Only one player could be controlled via keyboard
- **Solution**: Implemented separate control schemes for each player

## 🎯 **New Control Scheme**

| Action | Player 1 | Player 2 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Move Left | A | ← |
| Move Right | D | → |
| Jump | W | ↑ |
| Attack | SPACE | ENTER |

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Single Browser Testing** (Both players in one window):
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Login with Vorld credentials
3. Create a game room
4. **In the same browser tab**, you can now control both players:
   - **Player 1**: Use WASD + SPACE
   - **Player 2**: Use Arrow Keys + ENTER
5. Start the game
6. **Wait 2 seconds** - first weapon should spawn automatically
7. **Every 10 seconds** - new weapons will spawn
8. Walk over weapons with either player to pick them up
9. Attack to see enhanced damage

### **Multi-Browser Testing** (Separate windows):
1. **Browser 1**: Create room, control with WASD + SPACE
2. **Browser 2**: Join room, control with Arrow Keys + ENTER
3. Each browser window will only respond to its focused keyboard
